# 30-Minute Product Thinking Interview

You’ve already used the Playground guide to design, build, and maybe even deploy a small app with AI. You’ve kicked the tyres, seen what’s possible, and learned how the tools behave.

Now we’re going to slow things down just enough to think clearly about **what you actually want to build next**.

In this guide, ChatGPT becomes your product-thinking coach. Together you’ll take whichever idea feels most important now – whether it’s the Playground app evolved, or a different idea entirely – and shape it into a clear, structured, ready-to-build product brief.

In the next 30 minutes you will:

- Understand the real problem you’re solving  
- Define who you’re building for  
- Clarify why your idea matters  
- Turn your thoughts into a simple product brief  
- Leave with a *clear next step*

No code.  
No tools.  
Just thinking — guided, step by step.

## What you’ll do now

### 1. Open ChatGPT in a new tab  

You’re going to run a single prompt that turns ChatGPT into your product-thinking coach — not a code vending machine.

### 2. Paste the prompt below  

It will interview you, challenge your assumptions, and help you shape the idea like an experienced product person would.

### 3. Answer honestly  

There are no wrong answers. The tool adapts to you.

## 30-Minute Product Thinking Interview (copy / paste)

```markdown
You are my product-thinking coach.

Your job is to interview me until we have a clear, structured, ready-to-build product brief.
Do not let me stay vague. Ask one question at a time.

Go through these steps:

1. Problem clarity
   - What problem am I solving?
   - For whom?
   - Why does it matter right now?
   - What happens if they never solve it?

2. Audience definition
   - Who exactly experiences this problem?
   - What makes them a good early user?
   - Where do they already hang out online?
   - What have they already tried?

3. Outcome definition
   - What does “success” look like for the user?
   - What job does this product do in their life/work?

4. Core workflow
   - What is the simplest end-to-end flow that solves the problem?
   - Ask me to describe it in 5–7 steps, as if I’m describing a story.

5. Scope boundaries
   - What is IN scope for version 1?
   - What is OUT of scope? (Enforce constraints.)

6. AI build readiness
   - Based on the above, help me write a clean, maintainable product brief.
   - Use simple language.
   - Structure it clearly (Problem → Audience → Job-to-be-done → User Flow → v1 Scope).

Interview me and push until the answers are crisp.
Then produce the final brief.
```

## What you’ll have at the end

Within half an hour you’ll walk away with:

- A clear problem statement  
- A specific target user  
- A sharp user outcome  
- A simple user flow  
- A clean product brief you can act on  
- Zero overwhelm

This brief is the foundation for everything that follows:

- AI-assisted development prompts  
- Tool choice (Lovable, v0, Replit, Cursor etc.)  
- Feature planning and validation conversations  
- Your first prototype

It prevents the most common trap: rushing to “just build” and ending with a confused, unmaintainable mess.

## Next step (after the interview)

When you have your product brief, go to:

👉 **Guide 01 — Product Thinking**  
`/guides/01-product-thinking.md`

This guide shows how to turn your brief into a version-1 that an AI can actually build — maintainable, testable and useful.

---

## A few practical tips

- Be specific. Replace “small business” with “independent café owners in London”.  
- Use real examples from your life or work; they make answers far more useful.  
- If you get stuck, say “I don’t know” — the coach will work with that and ask the right follow-ups.  
- Keep answers short at first; the coach will ask for detail when it matters.

## Why this works

Most people start with code. The successful start with clarity.  
This interview gives you the product thinking muscle you’ll need to use AI well — not to be tricked by it.

Instead of asking AI to spit out features on demand, you’re teaching it to behave like a patient mentor: asking better questions, capturing your decisions, and suggesting sensible next steps. Over time, this builds the habit of treating AI as a collaborator you orchestrate — not a magic answer box.

Once you’ve finished, you’ll have something worth sharing and something worth building.  
If you want faster progress, the coaching programme helps you turn that brief into a working product in 12 weeks with reviews, architecture coaching and accountability.
