# The AI Product Playbook

A friendly, hands-on path to building your first AI-powered product — even if you’ve never coded, used GitHub, or touched an AI IDE before.

## Welcome — you’re in the right place

If you have a product idea in your head, a problem you want to solve, or a workflow you want to improve, but you’re not sure where to start…

This guide shows you exactly what to do, step by step.

There’s no jargon.
There’s no assumed knowledge.
You don’t need technical skills.
You don’t need to understand GitHub.

Everything here is designed to be simple, clear, and practical.

## What this is

This is a learn-by-doing journey that teaches you how to think, plan, and build like a modern product creator — using AI tools that make the process easier and far more accessible.

You’ll learn how to:

- Shape a clear product idea
- Understand who you're building for
- Avoid the traps most beginners fall into
- Create your first working prototype
- Develop your product step-by-step
- Build confidence and momentum as you go

All with tools you can use right now.

## What this isn’t

This is not about:

- “vibe coding” without a plan
- messy auto-generated apps that break immediately
- hype
- hacks
- shortcuts that fall apart

The goal here is clarity, simplicity, progress, and real outcomes.

## How to use this guide

You’ll progress through a short series of practical steps.

Each step helps you produce something real — not just read about it.

You’ll start with a simple exercise inside ChatGPT that takes about 30 minutes and gives you your first “aha” moment: a clear, structured product idea that finally makes sense.

After that, you’ll try tiny builds using beginner-friendly tools like:

- Lovable
- Bolt
- v0
- Replit

And once you’re ready, you can explore AI coding environments like Cursor or Claude Code — but only when the time is right, and never before you feel confident.

## Your first step: The 30-Minute Product Interview

This is where everything begins.

It’s simple:
ChatGPT will ask you the right questions in the right order and help you shape your idea into a clear, practical product brief.

You don’t need anything else.
Just click below and follow the guided conversation.

## What you’ll have by the end

By the time you finish the early steps, you will have:

- A clear product idea
- A defined user
- A simple set of use cases
- A product plan
- Your first prototype
- A sense of momentum
- A feeling of: “I can actually do this.”

And that’s the whole point — to turn uncertainty into capability, fast.

A living, growing project

This isn’t a static book.

New guides, examples, walkthroughs, videos, and templates will be added regularly - and you can contribute too.

This is a community-led resource designed to grow with you.

## Ready? Let’s begin

The first step is simple and genuinely enjoyable.

👉 Start here: 30-Minute Product Interview

Once you’ve completed it, you’ll know exactly what to do next.

## If you’re building seriously

If you want accountability, direction, and tailored guidance for turning a product idea into something real — there’s a coaching programme built specifically for that.
You’ll find details inside the later steps.

For now, focus on getting started. You’ll gain more in the first 30 minutes than most people do in a week of trying alone.
