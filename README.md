# The AI Product Playbook

A simple, hands-on path to building your first AI‑powered product without getting lost in hype, mess, or magic‑prompt promises - even if you've never coded, used GitHub, or touched an AI development tool before.

## Why this playbook exists

Every day you see some version of:

> "Anyone can now ship a million‑dollar app in a weekend with AI."

Yes, anyone can now open an AI tool and generate impressive code.
No, that does **not** mean you can skip product thinking and still expect a sustainable, useful product.

You don’t need to become a full‑stack engineer.
You *do* need just enough product and systems thinking to avoid crashing the car into the wall.

This playbook gives you that thin, practical layer:

- clear thinking before code
- lightweight structure instead of chaos
- AI as a coach, not a vending machine

Maybe you’ve already paid an agency or freelancer to "build it for you" and ended up with something fragile, half‑finished, or nothing at all — plus all the knowledge walked out the door when they did. This playbook takes the opposite approach: it keeps the product thinking, decisions, and documentation in your hands so that any specialist you hire later plugs into *your* system, instead of you being dependent on theirs.

## Who this is for

This repo is for you if:

- you have an idea, side project, or workflow you want to improve
- you’re not a career engineer (or you are, but not a product person)
- you’re comfortable with tools like ChatGPT / Claude, but unsure how to use them to build something real
- you want a path that respects your time and doesn’t drown you in jargon or tooling

You don’t need to understand GitHub, IDEs, or frameworks to get started.

## What you’ll learn (by doing)

Through short, guided exercises you will:

- shape a crisp product idea
- define exactly who you’re building for and why it matters now
- map the simplest end‑to‑end user flow
- avoid the classic “AI auto‑generated app” failure modes
- ship a first working prototype using beginner‑friendly tools
- build habits for working with AI as a thinking partner, not just a shortcut

All with tools you can use today.

## How this is different

This is **not**:

- another bag of clever prompts
- yet another boilerplate code repo you’re scared to touch
- “vibe coding” without a plan
- messy auto‑generated apps that break immediately
- hacks and shortcuts that fall apart the moment you change anything

Instead, the prompts and guides here:

- treat the AI tool as a **patient coach** (product strategist, UX designer, engineer, growth partner, etc.)
- ask you the questions you wouldn’t think to ask yourself
- document decisions and next steps as you go
- build your product *and* your skills at the same time

You’re not just getting outputs; you’re learning how to orchestrate AI and human work together – the core skill of the next decade.

## How the playbook is organised

The repo is intentionally simple:

- **`guides/00-playground-build.md`**  
  Everyone starts here. Use a light coaching prompt to pick a tiny, real problem from your life, then build and **deploy** a small, genuinely useful app in an AI playground (we suggest Google AI Studio).

- **`start-here/START-HERE.md`**  
  Your next 30 minutes. A product‑thinking interview that deepens whichever idea you now care about, and turns it into a clearer, more deliberate product brief.

- **`guides/01-product-thinking.md`**  
  Builds on that brief and helps you shape a version‑1 that an AI (or a future team‑mate) can actually help you build and evolve.

- **`templates/`**  
  Lightweight worksheets and scripts you can copy into your own notes or tools.

You can read everything in plain Markdown. No IDE required.

## Recommended sequence

1. **Playground Build – Guide 00**  
   `guides/00-playground-build.md`
2. **Product Thinking Interview**  
   `start-here/START-HERE.md`
3. **Guide 01 – Product Thinking**  
   `guides/01-product-thinking.md`

## If you’re building seriously

If you already know you want more than a free playbook – accountability, reviews, and tailored guidance to take a product from idea to launch over 12 weeks – there is a coaching programme that uses this exact system as its foundation.

You’ll find details inside the later guides.

For now, start with the first 30 minutes. You’ll get more clarity from that than from a week of scrolling “AI build” threads.
